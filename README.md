 Case Management Database Design

## Executive Summary

The Case Management Database is designed to efficiently manage legal cases, storing client information, case details, and court dates in a MongoDB document database. This database aims to streamline case management processes, improve data organization, and enhance accessibility for legal professionals.

## Project Requirements

The database should:

- Store client information, including name, contact details, and relevant identifiers.
- Manage case details such as case number, type of case, and associated parties.
- Record court dates, hearings, and other important events related to each case.
- Support efficient querying and retrieval of case information.
- Ensure data integrity and security through proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
